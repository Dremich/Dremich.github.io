											<h2>Water Pump Competition</h2>
										</header>
										<p>During the first year of my undergrad at the U, I took a class called ME 1000.
										This was the introductory mechanical engineering class, and we were put into groups 
										and tasked with designing and building a water pump. 
										<br/> <br/>
										The goal was to be able to pump the most amount of water in 1-minute. We had 4 months,
										$50 for ACE hardware parts, access to CAD and a MakeBlock lab, and a challenge before us.
										<br/> <br/>
										Here's how it went!
