								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>This is a project recap for my team's submission to the ME 1000 water pump competition at the University of Utah. We were given a small budget at ACE hardware, access to MakeBlock parts, a toolbox, a labspace, and the goal of pumping as much water as possible in 1 minute. We were put into teams of 4, and given 2 months to work. Here is team SAPP (Single Action Piston Pump!). Our project went like this:</p>

								<br></br>
								<h2>Research and Planning</h2>
								<span class="image right fourty"><img src="image0.png" alt="" />First drawing of piston pump idea<hr class = "minor"/></span>
								<p>To start, we each read about the different types of water pump options. We looked at the archimedes screw, rope pumps, gear pumps, and of course, the piston pump. Each member of the team made a pitch for the pump of their choice, and at the end we took a vote. We decided on the piston pump. We then gave ourselves a week to research the mechanics behind piston pumps, and then we got together to <strong>brainstorm</strong>.</p>
								<p>The premise behind a piston pump is pretty simple: You need a piston to create suction to pull up the water, and you need check valves to stop the water from falling between piston cycles. We focused on coming up with design ideas for each of these components. We had a few meetings just drawings things on whiteboards and throwing out oddball ideas. After we settled on a few, we used a decision matrix to select our final design. Then started preparing for our first design review.</p>

								<br></br>

								<h2>Initial Design Review</h2>
								<p>For our initial design review, we presented our progress so far to Dr. Taylor, and he gave us feedback and suggestions for our design moving forward. Dr. Taylor seemed impressed by our progress by the time of the review, but he had a few concerns about the design.</p>
								<p>Our piston design used two PVC pipe caps sandwiching an O-ring around one smaller PVC pipe. Dr. Taylor said that the O-ring would provide too much friction against the sides of our PVC piston chamber, and that while there may be water leakage without the O-ring, it would be trading drops for liters.
								   Additionally, we hadn't worked out the details of our slider-crank mechanism yet, and he gave us some advice on to how make sure that the rod stayed straight and fit within the piston chamber.</p>

								<p>After initial design review, we reevaluated our pump design. Our check valve design was originally made from a ball and a rubber stopper. The ball would be pushed up by the water, and then would fall down into the stopper creating a seal to stop the water from falling down in-between piston cycles. We realized, however, that it was going to be very difficult to choose a ball with the correct weight, and a rubber stopper with a tapered hole would be almost impossible to manufacture with the tools we had available.
								<br></br>	
								Then, Dru had the amazing idea of using a rubber washer to create a simple one-way seal. It was cheap, and very effective, as we demonstrated in our prototype!
								<br></br>
								Additionally, we redesigned the piston so that we could 3D-print it instead of building it out of PVC. Not only did this make it cheaper and easier to build, but it also made attaching a slider-crank much easier. Go 3D-printing!

								<p>Building was a long process. We only worked for a couple hours once a week during our dedicated lab time, and it was often fairly crowded with limited access to tools and TA's. Our team worked pretty quickly, though! The body of the pump was pretty easy. We got the parts we needed from ACE, cut the PVC to length, and then stuck it together in just one or two lab sessions. After we printed the piston and check valves, we were ready for our first test!</p>
								
								<p>Pumping by hand, we were able to get a decent flow rate. Now we just needed to slap on the slider-crank mechanism. Unfortunately... we had kind of been ignoring that part of the design, and so this was easier said than done. We had a few ideas from our initial pump design, but they all seemed clunky and inefficient. We had been planning on 3D-printing a large wheel to which we would attach the piston arm, but that would take a large amount of filament (of which we had a limited amount), and would probably cause wobble in the piston arm.</p>
								<span class="image left thirty"><img src="sliderCrankDemo.webp" alt="" />Testing the <i>smooothness</i> of the slider-crank.<hr class = "minor"/></span>
								<p>Fortunately, I had a bit of inspiration while we had been stabilizing the body of pump design when we talked to another group who was doing a double action piston pump. They had these very elegant and small slider-cranks, and I realized that we didn't need to make something nearly as large as we initially had thought. I sat down and started playing around with the make-block parts we had available, and I came up with a slider-crank mechanism using just cuttable linkages that ended up working pretty well! It took us a while to get the supports lined up, but once we did, it worked <i>pretty well*.</i></p>

								<p><i>*Pretty well</i> can only get you so far. We were having binding issues when we tried to run the pump with the motor, and we were really worried that we were going to burn it out (which would <b>disqualify us</b> from the competition!!).
								<br></br>
								At first, we thought that there was just too much friction between the O-ring around the piston and the sides of the PVC piston chamber. (Dr. Taylor in our initial design review told us not to use an O-ring for this exact reason.) However, when we tried running the pump without the O-ring, there was no suction and so we couldn't pump water at all, even by hand. Good thing we kept the O-ring! We then tried adding lubricant and filing down the groove in the piston to reduce rubbing between the O-ring and the piston sides, but there was little change. We also changed to a lower gear ratio so that the piston arm had more power, and this did reasonably improve things, but there was still more binding than we were comfortable with.
								<br></br>
								After significant head scratching, I noticed that the piston chamber itself seemed... slanted. Ah... the piston was pushing into a diagonal piston chamber. Whoops. We redid the support structure for the pump to ensure that it was level with the piston, and voil√†! We had a working piston pump!
								</p> 

								<h2>Competition Day</h2>
								<p>This was it. The moment everyone had been waiting for. Our grades, our semester, and our livelihoods depended on the outcome of this competition. Each group was given a set time to run their pump in front of the instructor in the lab. Then, you had 10 minutes to make any adjustments, and ran it again. You're score was determined by the higher of the two runs. The lab was overflowing with bustling engineering students. People were running around, asking for toolboxes and parts, making last minute modifications to their design. Our group waited patiently for our turn: we knew how our run was going to go, we had tested our pump dozens of times and it was very reliable. Here was our run:</p>

								<h2>Results and Takeaways</h2>
								<p>We pumped <b>10 gallons</b> of water in 1 minute!! This was not the winning amount... The top group in our class pumped like 45 gallons of water in one minute. However, we knew going into the competition that we weren't going to be the top team. Piston pumps are simply not very efficient, especially compared to gear pumps and centrifugal pumps, so my team was not expecting to win the contest. We did, however, pump the most water of any team who made a piston pump, as far as I am aware. Also, piston pumps are awesome soooo who really won here? &#128513</p>
								<p>After the competition, we did an analysis of our performance. We identified a few ways that we could have done better. Primarily, we were able to get our motor curves for the competition run. We were running significantly uunder our ideal power usage, meaning that with a bit higher gear ratio we probably could have pumped a decent amount more water. Additionally, as you can see in the video, there is still some serious wobble in the motor support. A sturdier base for the motor would help straighten the piston pathway, letting the piston run more smoothly and allowing us to run it faster. Finally, we acknlowedged the fact that we couldn't actually see our check valves in action, nor what was happening within the piston chamber. Because we used opaque PVC, it was a blackbox. Knowing this, there is a high possibility that there were improvements we could have made to both of these components that we couldn't observe very well. There was clearly leaking out the back of the piston chamber during the competition run, which means that the piston didn't have a completely water-tight seal with the PVC.</p>
								<p>Overall though, I am very happy with the performance of our pump, and had a fantastic time working with my team members Quinna, Dru, and Brenden. And most importantly, I loved this class as an introduction to the engineering program at the U, and I can't wait to work on more projects!</p>
